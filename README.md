# tflite_image_classification
A template project which uses the power of Deep Learning. Using a Convolutional Neural Network to identify hotdogs from images.

## Getting Started
Simply pull the project, build and run on a real device. Running on an emulator does not seem to work best as they aren't powerful enough.
